# [My First Hackathon Q&A](https://www.facebook.com/events/1833492406893198/)

## Introduction

Hi! Our names are Ankita and Ellen! We are both on the Hack@Brown workshops team. Ankita is a sophomore and will be attending her 7th hackathon later this month and Ellen is a freshman and will be having her first hackathon experience at Hack@Brown this year. We’ll talk about our experiences, insights, helpful advice, and what to expect at your first hackathon. If you have any questions or concerns, please also feel free to reach out to us. Hope you find this helpful!

## What is a Hackathon?

A hackathon is all about trying to make something new and fun and interesting (possibly something that helps solve a problem you see around you) with a group of (maybe new) friends. There’s a definite time crunch, but it can spur you to do things that you wouldn’t have thought possible otherwise. Most importantly, a hackathon is what you make of it. It’s a great opportunity to focus on learning something new, or to finally bring an idea that’s been in the back of your mind for months to life. Hackathons, especially Hack@Brown, are full of mentors who can help you try new things, and we really encourage exploration. Think of it as two days of TA hours whenever you need them!

## Mentorship and Getting Help

Mentorship is a huge part of Hack@Brown. We have student and sponsor mentors available to help you with any problems that might come up. If you want the extra support, some mentors will be attached to teams for the duration of the hackathon to guide them through the process. In addition, all mentors hold office hours on the subjects they’re familiar with, so definitely drop by and ask them for advice. We also have a tool for you all called [HELPq](https://github.com/ehzhang/HELPq) where you can submit a ticket with your question and someone will come over and help you! And of course, there will be a help desk you can go to at any time to get guides, suggestions, and pointers towards more help.

Just to give you a general idea how much help is available, there will be over 70 company mentors from (just to name a few) Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Adobe at the hackathon ranging from people who can help you with design, Android development, hardware, anything you could possibly imagine! Before you get hacking, there will be a sponsor fair where you will have the opportunity to meet several mentors and to also learn who you can reach out to for your hacks. Check out the [sponsors](https://2017.hackatbrown.org/#sponsors) here!

## How do I stay in the loop?

Once you’re at the hackathon, there are several ways to stay on top of all the workshops and activities going on. A lot of info goes out over Facebook and Twitter, and our day-of event website. All this information will also be given to you when you register on Saturday.

## But I don’t know how to program...

Not a problem at all! Your contribution still matters and is very important! If you have an idea, you can easily execute by using online design tools that quite often do not require a single line of code…(just a great idea!) If you are a Brown student, take advantage of Adobe’s Creative Cloud products (they’re freeee) All Adobe’s applications come with quick, simple, and easy to learn tutorials. There's also [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), a free collaborative design tool that we'll have a workshop on at the hackathon. Hackathons are also a fantastic opportunity to build upon existing programming skills and to pick up new ones. Try to add something new to your repertoire! Just because you don’t have a huge amount of programming experience doesn’t mean you can’t contribute to a team as well. A non-programmer perspective often reveals something that would have otherwise been lost in the details of the code and can make your project that much more fun and approachable.

And if you haven’t heard already, [HackWeek](https://www.facebook.com/events/155276228299642/?active_tab=about) is NEXT WEEK! So many workshops and opportunities to learn from. Look out for workshops on design, hardware, iOS, HTML/CSS, and more! Most of these workshops will offer starter projects or will suggest a great place to get started when you begin to think of ideas for the hackathon. If you can’t attend a workshop, no worries! Check up on the events you’re interested in after and we’ll post documentation there for you to look at. There will also be plenty of workshops for you to attend during the hackathon from hardware to design, like creating an ios or android app, building an online portfolio, picking up HTML/CSS in an hour, and much more!  

## What’s my role as a designer?

Believe it or not, your role is crucial. All programmers need designers. Making it look nice is one thing, but making it useable is also really important. Hacks can be awarded for their designs, so in essence, it doesn’t have to work, but if it looks great, judges will recognize this! There is a workshop happening on [Sketch](https://www.facebook.com/events/2223488491210469/), a design tool that helps you create mock iOS apps that you can check out during [HackWeek](https://www.facebook.com/events/155276228299642/?active_tab=about).

## I want to do a hardware hack! (But... I’ve never worked with hardware before and I don’t own any hardware :( )

Not a problem at all! Hardware is a lot of fun and we’ll provide all the hardware and mentorship for you. Check out the [list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZoHAKlg1eA8iRODnH3OzRzuVGClZIPZfoqgGX1ozQ5w/edit) of hardware we’ll be providing. The H@B hardware team will also be doing demos of some hardware hacks and will have a workshop on the Arduino during the hackathon that you should definitely check out if you are interested!

## What’s the Schedule for the Weekend?

In addition to this, be sure to check out the schedule on the day-of website!

It is totally encouraged to sleep! You can go back to your dorm or grab an air mattress and take a nap in the sleeping room. There will also be plenty of things you can do to de-stress and chill like playing some ping pong in the game room or grabbing some tasty snacks or taking photos at the photobooth.

## APIs: What are they? How many can I use? How do I use them?

API stands for Application Programming Interfaces. They basically dictate how one application can talk to another and make it possible to move data between different programs. So what’s an example? Well you’ve actually encountered APIs before. How many of you have used Yelp? If you think about it, Yelp uses a Google Maps API to help you find nearby restaurants. Data is shared by both applications and Yelp can focus on its own features rather than reinventing the wheel.

APIs are easy to implement. Think of APIs as giving someone a little bit of exposure to a program’s internal functions. A developer doesn’t have to share all his code in order for you to also make use of it. In this way, they also save time and help you create super cool apps. You can tap into big companies like Facebook or Dropbox and combine their APIs or mash them up into your own unique app without writing that much code.

There will also be a directory of APIs from participating companies for you to use, and all of those companies will have mentors who can help you with their APIs if you get stuck. If you don’t have a particular API in mind, that’s a great place to start! You can use as many APIs as you want! Have fun!

## How do I find a team?

If you have a team going into the hackathon, that’s great! If not, that’s **also great**, and we’ll have time for team forming after the opening ceremony. We actually encourage you to work and meet new people! There will be people coming from all over the United States and the world for this hackathon, so get excited to meet people from diverse backgrounds and experiences!

You definitely don’t need to come with an idea before the hackathon! Next Friday, the day before the hackathon, there will be an [idea mixer](https://www.facebook.com/events/1194569613997599/) where everyone will talk about their ideas and get inspiration. We hope that you be open minded and try to find teammates who are interested in accomplishing the same things you are!

For team forming, people will first get to develop their ideas through a design thinking activity, and then mingle and look for others with an idea and team that interests them. Both teams and ideas will be in plentiful supply at the hackathon!

## How do I plan a project?

Bear in mind that your project doesn’t need to be completely finished and polished by the end of the hackathon, and it probably won’t be (to be fair, is anything ever finished?). The scope of your team’s project depends a lot on the team itself and what it wants to get out of Hack@Brown. If you’re trying something new, for example, that’s awesome, but it will take a bit more time to get things accomplished, and you should take that into consideration. On the other hand, it might not be all that fun to do something you’re very familiar with that won’t be an interesting challenge. Remember, you have a team, and brainstorming before you start building helps a lot. The Idea Mixer (happening the day before the hackathon) will be a great opportunity to meet new people for team forming and discussing ideas! If you’re curious about the projects that were submitted in the past, check them out [here](https://hackatbrown2016.devpost.com/).

## Demoing and Awards

Hacking officially begins on Saturday at 1PM and ends at around 11:30AM on Sunday! At this point, Project Expo begins! This is almost like that huge science fair you attended in high school where everyone presents their ideas and judges will walk around asking you questions, demoing your creations, and giving you feedback. You are also free to look at other projects as well, just make sure one of your teammates is at your table :) You will generally have about 2 minutes to make your pitch to a judge, so this is definitely something to think about and to prepare in advance, maybe by demoing to other hackers!

All projects are submitted online to [Devpost](https://hackatbrown2016.devpost.com/), a website for sharing hackathon projects.  Definitely check out the link! You’ll be able to see what people submitted last year and what awards were given! Everyone will have a chance to demo their project to judges, but only a few will be demo’d to everyone.

## Rules?

Hack@Brown is really your hackathon! There are no formal rules except that we expect you to be respectful and considerate of other people. You will be engaging with a diverse student body and it’s important to keep this in mind since Hack@Brown’s main goal is to promote inclusion and to make this an event that everybody feels comfortable in.

In addition, think about whether your hack is appropriate or not or whether it will offend anyone. If you have any questions or are not sure at any time, don’t hesitate to speak to Hack@Brown staff (the cool kids in white sweaters).

## What do I do when Hack@Brown is over?

Continue working on your idea! If you really enjoyed working on it, don’t let it stop. Hackathon projects are also a great thing to put on your portfolio. Definitely check out the [Collection of Innovation](http://innovateonthehill.com/) website for some great places at Brown and RISD to take your projects forward. If you’re looking for mentorship and inspiration, [**Startup@Brown**](http://startupatbrown.org/) is a great opportunity to connect with start-up leaders and attend workshops on building a start-up. If you have any questions about taking your ideas forward, here’s a great resource: [hello@startupatbrown.org](mailto:hello@startupatbrown.org).
